# ts-starter

A simple typescript starting for just doing typescript things.

To get started, install your dependencies, then edit `main.ts`!

```sh
yarn install
```

To run your `main.ts` you can invoke it with

```sh
yarn start
```

## Debugging

I've included a vscode debugging launch config that should Just Work.

## Guardrails

I've included default configurations for the following tools that should play nice together:

- ESLint
- Typescipt
- Prettier

They probably need fine tuning for serious work, but they should cause alerts for common errors.
